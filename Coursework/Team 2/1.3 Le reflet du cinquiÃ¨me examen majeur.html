<span style="font-size: 130%;">For Question 7, I'm not very familiar with the concept of efficiency and the number of times to call a method. Random methods' average calls are not very facile.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 130%;">A lot of other problems are answered wrong because I was not very careful when reading the questions. Next time I should read them more carefully and slowly.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 130%;">Speaking of reading slowly, I should increase the speed of answering questions, since I left blank in last two questions, of which I lost lots of marks. Why? Because I thought there were only 13 questions in the paper, and I stopped writing as soon as I reached Question 13. I should be more careful next time. I should go through the whole paper first then answer the question.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 130%;">P8 (E) I didn't consider the question comprehensively, so I lost marks on it. I should slow down at the questions with big marks</span></div>
