<span style="font-size: 120%;">Defining the problem</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">My mother (my client), who has worked as an accountant for more than 20 years, has a habit of keeping accounts of the incomes and outgoings in our home. However she realized that after years of the traditional approach: designing the from, handwriting or typing to put all the numbers into a form, and calculations the result, it is way too complicated in a digital age. So she hopes that there can be a software to keep track of a family’s accounting situation and help people with organizing their financial status, especially when they want a surplus by the end of each month. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">Success criteria</span><br />
<br />
<ul><li><span style="font-size: 120%;">Allow the user to input incomes and outgoings easily for any number of times. </span></li><li><span style="font-size: 120%;">Do calculations quickly about the accounting situation for the family in accordance to the users’ needs.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 120%;">Draw statistical charts and graphs whenever users need and by the end of each month.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 120%;">Give suggestions to users according to the proportion of money spending with statistics stored.</span></li></ul><br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">Rationale for the proposed product</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">I decided to use Java for the following reasons:</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-size: 120%;">I am familiar with java</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 120%;">It runs on a considerable number of different platforms</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 120%;">It has a good development environment</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 120%;">It is object oriented so methods can be written and tested separately to allow each of them to work effectively</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 120%;">It allows the existence of encapsulation which can protect the privacy of the users, in this case especially because no one would want his/her family’s financial status to be shown to others or to be changed accidentally </span></li></ul></div>
