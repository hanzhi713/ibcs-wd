<br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">I have checked my answer. Maybe there are some difference between the answers in my mind and the answers on my paper because I only remember a little part of my answers. But I find lots of mistakes by checking this part of my answer with mark sachem. I think i have got 3 mistakes of multiple choices question and the inaccuracy is 33.3% which is really horrible. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">The first mistake is the first question. In fact, I think that is the serious problem I had because this is caused by my careless. When I first thought about this problem, I think that I can calculate the power of 16 and minus one then I can get my answer. Nevertheless, when I do the calculation, I forget to minus one.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">The second mistake is the fifth question. When I did that question, I actually ignore the mistake of the second method, but after I knew the correct answer, I found that the mistake of this problem is as same as the first method.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">The third mistake is the seventh one. I think that is the mistake I can or I should make because I still had a slight confusion about abstract class when I did this question. When I read choice E, I didn’t find the mistake of it but I can’t understand why I think choice D is the correct answer, I actually think choice D is true at that time…</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">I don’t remember completely answers of my structured questions but I find I didn’t give enough details for some explanation questions. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">About the knowledge I learned about Java. I think the time I spent on review is not enough. Actually I always put CS review at the last because I think there is nothing need to take my time and I can spend lots of time on it without any limits. But the real situation is that there is always more thing I need to do or I fell asleep at that time. Such as the night before Wednesday, I think I need to prepare for CS major again but I really felt asleep at that time. So I waste the night I should spend on computer science. I think I will change my plan from now.</span></div>
