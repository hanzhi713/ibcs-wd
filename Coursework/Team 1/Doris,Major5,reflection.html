<span style="font-size: 120%;">Question 3 is a question concerns binary search and linear search. The prerequisite for binary search is it should be an ordered array. All of the options are irrelevant to both algorithm except option C.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">After taking some examples, I find that the initial place of the data and the new place reflects on minor diagonal. I used to think it is swap(mat,i,j,SIZE-i-1.SIZE-j-1);</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">And I lost all marks for short answer questions. The mistake of the first problem is I didn’t read the question and I thought it is from lowest to highest. Mistake to second question is I made a mistake when I calculating the second value of X.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">The mistake I made for 11.b is I forget to allocate the data following the order of the array. I should follow the order of an array and sort in alphabetical order. I also need to use arrows to represent the relationship between data.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">For 11.e, the main mistake is I use Java instead of pseudocode. There are also some mistakes such as it doesn’t avoid replicating calculation by starting the inner loop of N+1. I also didn’t assign the value on the diagonal. I didn’t check whether it is the “centro&quot; or not.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 120%;">12.A test of the most basic characters of OOP. It should be re-use code, faster development sub-groups and so on. I think the question of 12.f is really difficult to understand because I even thought ST is a loan object. For 14.b, I should write the attribute for each short term book object. The Boolean borrow right is the attribute for the student object.</span></div>
