<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18.2px;"><strong>Question 1: Explain why is it important to have GPUs and large labeled data sets in order to train CNNs [2]</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;; font-size: 11px;">Because training of CNN involves large amount of matrix calculations, so GPUs’ high calculating speed is important. Large labeled data sets are used to adjust the parameters in the fully connected layers in the network. If only small amount of data is provided, the CNN may not be able to be adjusted to the optimal state. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18.2px;"><strong>Question 2: CNNs are usually preferential to MLPs because of their capability of down sampling and its shift-invariant property. Explain briefly how down sampling and the shift-invariant property are achieved in CNN. [4]</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Down sampling happens in the polling step. For example, when doing image recognition, only the maximum unit in a 3*3 block is taken. This decrease the size of sample data. The convolution steps extract the features in the data. For example, a convolution kernel may be used to outline the contour of objects, identifying the target wherever it is. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18.2px;"><strong>Question 3</strong></span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18.2px;"><strong>Outline the role of the nearest neighbor algorithm for self-driving cars. [2]</strong></span></li></ol><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;; font-size: 11px;">It is a greedy algorithm that can be used to try to find the shortest route from the cars’ position to its destination. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18.2px;"><strong>(b) Explain one limitation of the nearest neighbor algorithm [2]</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;; font-size: 11px;">The TSP problem is a NP-hard problem, so this algorithm cannot guarantee finding the shortest route.</span></div>
