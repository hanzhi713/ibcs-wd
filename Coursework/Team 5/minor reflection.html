For this major test, my test result is not so good, here are problems I have.<br />
First, the definition and some concepts are not so clear, the ideas in polymorphism have some problem. Like the dancer example we learned in class, I forgot how it works and made it wrong。And I doesn’t know the definition of UMI, so I lose 4 marks. And I need to know the requirements for outline question.<br />
Generally, I need to spend more time on computer science, although it seems like I understand the concepts of different knowledge but I didn’t make it clear and I lose quite a lot mark on it. More details need to be sorted and learn.</div>
