<span style="font-family: AppleGothic; font-size: 20px;">The Basic principle on state machine(traffic light example explained)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">BY MICHAEL QIAN</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: AppleGothic; font-size: 12px;">The actual principle of the traffic light program actuated by the python program is the “state machine”. That put in a set of input value then it gives out the out put value according to its states. There is a graph that could illustrate this: </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: AppleGothic; font-size: 12px;">S = {0,1,2} </span><br />
<span style="font-family: AppleGothic; font-size: 12px;">#This is the defined states</span><br />
<span style="font-family: AppleGothic; font-size: 12px;">I = {a,b,c}</span><br />
<span style="font-family: AppleGothic; font-size: 12px;">#input</span><br />
<span style="font-family: AppleGothic; font-size: 12px;">O = {Red, Green，Yellow}</span><br />
<span style="font-family: AppleGothic; font-size: 12px;">#output</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: AppleGothic; font-size: 12px;">As you see we include a set of starting values which defines input values and output values</span><br />
<span style="font-family: AppleGothic; font-size: 12px;">One intuitive understanding of the state machine is that there are different conditions for entering each given state, these are the input we put in, and the embedded algorithm is used to produce the output results(algorithm illustrated by the graph).</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: AppleGothic; font-size: 12px;">In the special case of the traffic light, there are three situations the Red light, Green light, Yellow light. These are the outputs of the state machine. In detail, when Red light is lit, it gives red light a True value and give the rest of the variable a False value. Moreover, the input of that state machine is controlled by the time when a set time period has passed the input value changes between a, b, c since there are no stopping the loop goes on and on forever.</span></div>
