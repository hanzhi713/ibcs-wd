<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">According to recent tests results, I am a little bit confused about my CS study. I went over the basic concepts just as the teacher mentioned us to do so. However, even after I check the mark scheme, I found that my test result quite unbelievable. Since I haven’t looked at my test papers yet, So I could only speculate the reasons of this failure, for now I think the problem would be my expressions, maybe I am familiar with some of the ideas but just could clearly express it and my carelessness could also be a reason I got a such low score. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">However, after all the programming homework I have done, I have been quite familiar with the practical skills of programming, the thing which struck me is that I just couldn’t get a good score in the theoretical assignments. For me, there are two things need to be solved, I need to have a decent communication with the teacher and figure out which part of my study went wrong. Moreover, I also want to urge not to have such questions like listing benefits and costs, or advantages or disadvantages. These question can rarely bring us any actual value while programming nor in the actual exam considering such things are debatable and is based on personal judgements, and there is no meaning behind that since we are route learning it. I am hoping for some practical tests which actually improves our programming skills, even pseudo codes. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">If these questions were to appear in the actual exam, I have one provision, I think most of us need to do some of the real past question to actually practice, to actually do something that is related to our major assessments, or it is impossible for most of us to neither predict nor expect what will be included in the next major, sometimes what we are preparing is quite the opposite of what we are having on the major. Thus, I sincerely hope that we could have more practice on major, instead of instructions. </span><br />
