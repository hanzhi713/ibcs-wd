<ol><li><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">there was some proper noun I did understand. For example,Tail recursion . “Tail recession is when the recursive call of a method is made as the las executable step of the method. Divide-and-conquer algorithms like this used in merge sort or quick sort have recursive calls before the last step. Thus, statement II us false”</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">8 k can not start at 1, it is going to throw a error.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">10 I mixed the position of x and y. if we use x%y, the remainder should be x not y.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">11（b）tree should be binary that each one should only connect to two smaller part.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">(e) I misunderstand what question asked. I though it only asked to return one number. However, the question wanted us to return the hole graph .</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">12(a) I forgot the definition of OOP. So I couldn’t remember the advantages.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">(b) I didn’t quite understand what is mean by ethical issues and I thought it is for user.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">(e) I didn’t remember the definition of static for variable.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">14（a）I changed it many times then I confused myself, so I write public as private</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">(d)I was confused about “an OOP technique”, I thought it is a special method.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">I think I mainly learnt several points from this major. First is I should really may more attention to remember all definitions. I almost fail all of them. Second, every mark worth one point. I shouldn’t think maybe this point worth two marks then only write two points.Last but not least, Should read the question more carefully, make sure I understand it totally, then begin to work.</span></div>
