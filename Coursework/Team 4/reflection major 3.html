<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">For the question 3, I forgot constructor can bot be inheritance. For the question 4&amp;5 the variable will disappear our of the function, so it will print what it was before that is the reason why the answers are A. For the question 6, I didn’t see the two lines with super.For the question 7, because the subclass can also be abstract .For question 10(b), I saw in specimen it “private Species toa” but I thought in the book, inheritance was together with composition, then because I don’t how how to describe that, I write composition.(E) I didn’t think about the compiler.11(a)I didn’t remember the accurate definition. </span><br />

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">I think I didn't pay a lot of attention of the definition. This is the result I could not write out many things. I think this is because when programming, I can search for anything when I need them. In the future, I am going to try to remember all definitions and rules in my mind. Also, I should think more by myself, rather than use memory.</span></div>
