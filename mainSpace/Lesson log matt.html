<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Binary to hexadecimal:</span><br />
Take each 4 places as one place for hexadecimal. For example, 1110 1011 0011, 1110=E, 1011=B, 0011=3, so it’s hexadecimal= EB3.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Binary to decimal places:</span><br />
From the first figure of right, it refers to 2 to the power of 0. The next one is 2 to the power of 1. And so on… Take 110111 as an example, it’s 2^0+2^1+2^2+2^4+2^5=1+2+4+16+32<br />
It’s 55.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">How to change decimal to Binary.</span><br />
Find the nearest power of 2 and separate it down step by step.<br />
For example 71, 71-64(2^6)=7, 7-4(2^2)=3=2+1, so it’s binary representation is 1000111.<br />

Bubble sort. Each time shift the big one to the right so after one iteration the last one is the biggest. Repeat.<br />
<br />
Insertion: separate the array into one sorted one and one unsorted. The first figure is in the sorted array, and the second one should place at the right place in the sorted array, either before the first figure or after it. Repeat till all is sorted.<br />
<br />
Selection sort: choose the biggest and swap it to the last, iterate.<br />
<br />
Merge: divide and conquer.<br />
<br />
Quick: choose the pivot, let the pointer start shift from both left and right. When the left is at the right pointer’s right, swap the left and right. When they meet. Swap with the pivot.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Logic gate:</span><br />
OR: output 1 when there is a 1 in input<br />
AND: output 1 when both input is 1<br />
NOT: give the opposite, 1 to 0, 0 to 1.<br />
NOR: opposite of OR<br />
NAND: opposite of AND<br />
XOR: output 1 when two inputs are opposite.<br />

Polymorphism, encapsulation and dynamic binding are three features of OOP.<br />
Polymorphism means one variable name could means different data type. Dynamic binding is based on that, it means use the required data type of certain variable. Encapsulation means put all data and methods in one class.<br />
