 <br />
<h2 id="toc1"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Primary memory"></a>Primary memory</h2>
 <h3 id="toc2"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Primary memory-Capacity"></a>Capacity</h3>
 Higher is better. The maximum capacity per memory module is 32 GB for desktop computers, 16GB for laptops. But memory with this high capacity is only developed recently, and therefore is very expensive. 16GB per module for desktop computers and 8GB per module in laptops are more affordable.<br />
<h3 id="toc3"> </h3>
 <h3 id="toc4"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Primary memory-Number of channels"></a>Number of channels</h3>
 Modern processors usually support multi-channel memory architecture. Double the number of channels also double the memory bandwidth. Generally, the number of channels supported depends on the number of cores of CPU. For example, the Intel U series processors which are commonly used in ultra-books and have 2 cores, support up to 2 memory channels. Intel HQ, T, K series have 4 cores, and therefore support up to 4 memory channels.<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc5"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Primary memory-Frequency:"></a>Frequency:</h3>
 The higher the frequency is, the greater the bandwidth. The common frequency for DDR3 (or LDDR3, the low voltage version) memories is 1333MHz and 1600MHz, while that for DDR4 memories is 2133MHz and 2400MHz. DDR4 memories are only widely used after 2015, and now they are supported by family Intel 6th Generation processors, and also future generations.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc6"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Secondary storage"></a>Secondary storage</h2>
 <h3 id="toc7"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Secondary storage-For HDD (hard disk drives):"></a>For HDD (hard disk drives):</h3>
 <h3 id="toc8"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Secondary storage-The number of disks"></a>The number of disks</h3>
 Double the number of disks doubles the capacity, and also the IO speed.<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc9"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Secondary storage-RPM (round per minute):"></a>RPM (round per minute):</h3>
 5400rpm HDDs are the most common. However, their performance is lower than those 7200rpm HDDS. HDDs with 10000rpm and above are only used in servers. Note that although the performance is proportional to the RPM, the stability decreases with the increase of RPM. High RPM HDDs are more likely to be damaged when in vibration.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc10"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Processor speed"></a>Processor speed</h2>
 <h3 id="toc11"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Processor speed-Core clock"></a>Core clock</h3>
 The frequency of a core. The performance of CPU is proportional to its core clock<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc12"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Processor speed-Number of Cores"></a>Number of Cores</h3>
 Theoretically, the performance of CPU will be doubled if the number of cores doubles, assuming that the programs have multi-core support.<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc13"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Processor speed-Size of Cache"></a>Size of Cache</h3>
 Larger is better. Usually, the CPU manufacturer will make its capacity reasonable. The capacity of cache required is proportional to the number of cores.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc14"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Network connectivity"></a>Network connectivity</h2>
 <h3 id="toc15"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Network connectivity-Bandwidth"></a>Bandwidth</h3>
 <br />
Higher is better, usually measured in Mbps. Note that 8Mb = 1Mib. The bandwidth for wired network ranges from 10Mbps to 1000Mbps. The most common bandwidth supported by mainstream routers is 100Mbps.<br />
<br />
For wireless, the bandwidth depends on the protocol and utilization of MIMO (Multiple input multiple output).<br />
802.11b/g/n/ac supports 11, 54, 150, and 433Mbps bandwidth, respectively. By MIMO, the bandwidth can be doubled/tripled/quadrupled.<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc16"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Network connectivity-Ping"></a>Ping</h3>
 The delay of data transmission, measured in milliseconds. Lower is better.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc17"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Screen resolution"></a>Screen resolution</h2>
 Higher is better. The quality of the display also depends on the pixel density, measured by the PPI (pixels per inch)<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc18"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Graphics processor"></a>Graphics processor</h2>
 <h3 id="toc19"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Graphics processor-CUDAs"></a>CUDAs</h3>
 The number of parallel workers in the GPU. Higher is better.<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc20"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Graphics processor-GPU core frequency"></a>GPU core frequency</h3>
 Higher is better<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc21"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Graphics processor-Graphical memory capacity"></a>Graphical memory capacity</h3>
 Higher is better.<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc22"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Graphics processor-Graphical memory frequency"></a>Graphical memory frequency</h3>
 <br />
Higher is better.<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc23"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Graphics processor-Graphical memory bit width"></a>Graphical memory bit width</h3>
 Higher is better<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc24"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Graphics processor-Graphical memory bandwidth"></a>Graphical memory bandwidth</h3>
 The product of frequency and bit width. Higher is better.<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc25"><a name="Major resources of a computer and their performance-determining factors-Graphics processor-FLOPS (floating point operations per second)"></a>FLOPS (floating point operations per second)</h3>
 <br />
Measure the ability of GPU to calculate floating point numbers. Higher is better.</div>
