<span style="font-family: 宋体; font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: #000000;">This lesson we had a brief introduction of the computer architectures and the fetch-execute cycle. The main architecture that is been using today was created by Von Neumann, the pioneer of the digital computer. The character of it are that 1.same memory holds data, instructions. 2.A single set of address/data buses between CPU and memory. The operations that it uses is a linear sequences of fetch-decode-execute operations for the sequence of instructions which make up the program.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: 宋体; font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: #000000;">The core of Von Neumann Architecture is fetch-decode-excute. The basic structure is that a CPU contains program counter(PC), current instruction register(MAR), memory data register(MDR), memory address register(MDR) and index register(IR). PC stores the address of the next instruction to be fetched. MAR will get the copied address and be placed. The location, or address, is found and the contents are placed in the MDR. The contents of the MDR are then copied to the CIR. Then the instruction is going to be executed.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: 宋体; font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: #000000;">For further learning, we are divided into different groups and we will make posters and time-lapse video. Those videos are going to be shown in the next class. </span></span></div>
