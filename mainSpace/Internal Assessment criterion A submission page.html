<ul><li><strong><span style="color: #ff0033; font-size: 13px;">Problem definition</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0033; font-size: 13px;">: please be focused on what your product is for and the need for it. Also the general discription. Do you need hardware or it is just an app on teacher's phone. Not very clear about the product.</span></li><li><strong><span style="color: #ff0033; font-size: 13px;">Rationale</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0033; font-size: 13px;">: Not only why you choose and use iOS, but also the choice of your topic.</span></li><li><strong><span style="color: #ff0033; font-size: 13px;">Success criteria</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0033; font-size: 13px;">: Not detailed enough. This is the standards you are going to be evaluated in the later section. Please check by yourself how you are going to write the evaluation part based on your success criteria here.</span></li></ul><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 13px;">Generally, the topic has excellent application background, however, the difficulty is extremely high. Especially you have to implement this on iOS. If it is PC based I think it is easier as we can use exsiting deep learning modules. I am not sure about if iOS has similar libraries to rely on. May be Python is a good choice. You can first implement on python if it works very well, you can move to iOS when you have time. But I think we should first let the idea work by maximizing the resources we could use.</span><br />

 <ul><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Problem definition: very good. Just one question: &quot; That’s why I think I should make an app for him&quot;, is your product just aimed for your friend, or it can be used by others as well?</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rationale for solution: The justification for swift is good! For modelling, &quot;I need huge amount of data, which mostly are weather and traffic&quot;, this is to train and validate your model. For real applications we should be able to read the traffic and weather data for that particular time, so you should include a module to do this. After getting the data you can input to your model and run compuation to get the optimized guide.</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Success criteria: Could be more specific, please refer to the sample IA. As this is the standards you are going to be evaluated in the later section. Please check by yourself how you are going to write the evaluation part based on your success criteria here.</span></li></ul><span style="color: #ff0000;">Get the iOS framework done first, you can use a heuristic method for routing first. Then you can improve your model and algorithm. Great topic and difficulty.</span><br />

 <ul><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Problem definition:</span><ul><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The problem is to make the traditional game be electronic, which is inconvenient to set up and play otherwise.</span><ul><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">1. GUI and rules framework -- automatic game platform for two players: Traditionally, You may use the setup for game GO to play gomoku, you may draw your own board to play etc. But is not easy to replay and reset.</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">2. For single player: need the machine to be able to play with him/her. So we need algorithm for AI.</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The problem background is not valid, please modify, use real cases.</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rationale for solution:</span><ul><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Two parts:</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 1 is the justification for why you do this is reasonable.</span><ul><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;The reason to code this game is to understand the strategies Gomoku player may deal with</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">and make a AI which could respond every movement player done. &quot; ??? Why you do this is because your client wants!</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part 2 is the justification of your choice of tools ( programming language)</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Success criteria:</span><ul><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do not state your personal opinions here...</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot; AI should have many strategies to respond instead of one, the movement should be randomly chosen. If the movement of AI could be predicted, then it will be too boring to play with.&quot; This is inappropriate.</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;Algorithm will be used in the game for AI to respond. Machine learning will be used to learn situations and make respond to each movement of the player and make the best choice of it. Alpha beta tree will be use to do finite calculation. Monte carl AI will be another important algorithm to be used.&quot;</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Success criteria is the standard you are going to be evaluated in the later section.

 <ul><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Problem definition: Very good to refer to the existing apps related to stylization.</span><ul><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">But this part should be client oriented, which means you should say what you do this from the point of view of the client.</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The art students hope to have a tool to .....</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Now we have stylization algorithm, it is very popular and we have apps.</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">The client's requirement could be achieved by applying the stylization algorithm.</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">For now What's the client want is not clear now...

Brightness, shadows etc are local features included in the neural network. We do not use them explicitly.</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">4. control and edit etc with GUI</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">5. apply style to new input image</span></li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">6. Create and save style for future use, or we can say create one's own filter??</span></li></ul></li></ul><span style="color: #ff0000;">In general, great topic, high level difficulty. Need to clarify the function of the product based on client more clearly! Think of the design.</span><br />
